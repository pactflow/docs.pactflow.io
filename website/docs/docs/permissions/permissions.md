## contract_data:bulk_delete:*

Bulk delete pacts (which just removes the pacts and their associated verifications), applications (which removes associated pacts, verification results, application versions and webhooks) or an integration (which removes all pacts, verification results and webhooks, but will leave any application which is referenced by another integration).

## contract_data:bulk_delete:team

Bulk delete pacts (see above) where consumer is assigned to the user's teams.

## contract_data:bulk_delete:own

Bulk delete pacts (see above) where consumer was created by the logged in user.

## contract_data:manage:*

Create, update, and delete any contract related data. This includes applications, application labels, application versions, tags, pacts, and verification results. It does not allow the user to perform bulk deletions (see [contract_data:bulk_delete:\*](#contract_data-bulk_delete)).

## contract_data:manage:team

## contract_data:read:*

View any contract related data. This includes applications, application labels, application versions, tags, pacts, and verification results.

## read_token:manage:own
