title: Predefined roles

_Eligible plans: Enterprise_

The PactFlow application comes with the following predefined roles. Each role is assigned a collection of [permissions](/docs/permissions).

## Administrator

The PactFlow tenant user will be assigned the Administrator role. They can then assign the Administrator role to other users.

#### Default permissions

- [`authentication_settings:manage:*`](/docs/permissions/#authentication_settingsmanage)
- [`contract_data:bulk_delete:*`](/docs/permissions#contract_databulk_delete)
- [`contract_data:manage:*`](/docs/permissions#contract_datamanage)
- [`deployment_and_release:record:*`](/docs/permissions#deployment_and_releaserecord)
- [`environment:manage:*`](/docs/permissions#environmentmanage)
- [`role:manage:*`](/docs/permissions#rolemanage)
- [`secret:manage:*`](/docs/permissions#secretmanage)
- [`system_account:manage:*`](/docs/permissions#system_accountmanage)
- [`system_preference:manage:*`](/docs/permissions#system_preferencemanage)
- [`team:manage:*`](/docs/permissions#teammanage)
- [`token:manage:own`](/docs/permissions#tokenmanageown)
- [`user:invite`](/docs/permissions#userinvite)
- [`user:manage:*`](/docs/permissions#usermanage)
- [`webhook:manage:*`](/docs/permissions#webhookmanage)

## User

All new users are assigned the `User` role (unless the default role has been updated in the [system preferences](/docs/user-interface/settings/preferences#system-preferences)). The `User` role is intended to work in conjunction with [team assignments](/docs/user-interface/settings/teams), and therefore has `manage:team` permissions (rather than `manage:*` permissions) for all resources that can be associated with a team. The `User` role should be assigned to all developers, testers and other users who create and verify contracts on the PactFlow platform.

#### Default permissions

A user with the guest role can only view contract related data through the UI and has no API access.

The guest role permissions may not be modified.

#### Permissions

## SwaggerHub

A user with the SwaggerHub role can provide an API Token for the SwaggerHub integration. This allows SwaggerHub to verify published pacts against live Swagger docs.

The SwaggerHub role permissions may not be modified.

#### Permissions

## Resetting permissions for predefined roles

Should you wish to reset the permissions assigned to each of the predefined roles back to their defaults as documented above (or upgrade from the globally scoped User role to the team scoped User role) you can follow these steps. Note that any custom roles will remain unaffected, and user/role assignments are unchanged.

- Click on the `API` button at the top right of the PactFlow dashboard.
- In the `Links` section, scroll down to the line where the `rel` column has a value of `pf:admin-roles`.
- Click on the green arrow in the `GET` column with the hover text "Follow link".
- Scroll up to the top of the page.
- In the Links section, if you can see the line with a `rel` of `pf:reset`, you have the permissions required to reset the roles. If you cannot see this relation, you do not have the required permissions.
- Click the yellow `!` button in the `NON-GET` column.
- Click the blue `Make Request` button. You will see a 200 OK response with the updated roles list.
