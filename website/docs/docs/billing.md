| If you see this item in your top navigation bar, [SmartBear Admin](https://support.smartbear.com/administration/docs/en/administration.html) is enabled on your account. To manage your account, refer to the SmartBear Admin [docs](https://support.smartbear.com/administration/docs/en/administration.html). | You are on PactFlow's legacy subscription management, and this guide applies. |

### Subscription Management

:::note enterprise customers
In case of an enterprise trial upgrade, plan change or other billing related enquiries, contact your Account Manager.

To make changes to your account, provide your **subscription ID** which can be found on the billing page of your account, and the URL you use to access your PactFlow account (for example, **foo.pactflow.io**).
:::

PactFlow uses [Chargebee](https://www.chargebee.com/) for subscription and billing management. 

You can access our billing dashboard via the "Subscription" menu in the Settings page or directly at https://pactflow.chargebeeportal.com/.

:::note
If you have multiple subscriptions, please ensure you upgrade the subscription that matches the "Subscription ID" on your billing page.

### Authentication

All accounts will have a primary billing Administrator (usually the person who setup the PactFlow account). They may login to the subscription platform via the email address used to create the account. To authenticate, you will receive a one-time password via email once you log in.

The account owner may login to our subscription portal through this page, or you may login directly to the Chargebee portal at https://pactflow.chargebeeportal.com/.

### Managing your Account

#### Enterprise plans

If you are upgrading to an Enterprise plan or want to change your account, contact your Account Manager.

To access your PactFlow account (for example, **foo.pactflow.io**) provide your **subscription ID** available on the billing page of your account.

#### All other plans

Account administrators can perform the tasks:

1. Modify the primary account information, such as name, email, and address
2. Upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your subscription
3. Add or manage payment methods, such as credit cards
4. Update billing address information
5. View billing history and previous invoices
