:::note enterprise customers
To upgrade from an enterprise trial, change your plan or other related billing enquiries, your Account Manager is your point of contact.

In order to make changes to your account, please ensure you provide your **subscription ID** which can be found on the billing page of your account, and the URL you use to access your PactFlow account (e.g. **foo.pactflow.io**).

### Subscription Management

PactFlow uses [Chargebee](https://www.chargebee.com/) for our subscription and billing management. 

You can access our billing dashboard via the "Subscription" menu in the Settings page or directly at https://pactflow.chargebeeportal.com/.

### Authentication

All accounts will have a primary billing Administrator (usually the person who setup the PactFlow account) and they may login to the subscription platform via the email address used to create the account. You will be sent a one time password to your email address upon login that you will use to authenticate.

The account owner may login to our subscription portal through this page, or you may login directly to the Chargebee portal at https://pactflow.chargebeeportal.com/.

### Managing your Account

#### Enterprise plans

If you are upgrading to an Enterprise plan or would like to change your account, you must do this through your Account Manager.

Please ensure you provide your **subscription ID** which can be found on the billing page of your account, and the URL you use to access your PactFlow account (e.g. **foo.pactflow.io**).

#### All other plans

Account administrators can perform the following functions once logged in:

1. Modify the primary account information, such as name, email and address
2. Upgrade, downgrade or cancel your subscription
3. Add or manage payment methods, such as credit cards
4. Update billing address information
5. View billing history and previous invoices
