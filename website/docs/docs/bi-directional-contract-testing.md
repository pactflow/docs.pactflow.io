## Introduction

Bi-Directional Contract Testing is a type of **static contract testing** where two contracts - one representing the consumer expectations, and another representing the provider capability - are compared to ensure they are compatible.

Teams generate a consumer contract from a mocking tool (such as Pact or Wiremock) and API providers verify a provider contract (such as an OAS) using a functional API testing tool (such as ReadyAPI). PactFlow then statically compares the contracts down to the field level to ensure that they remain compatible.

Bi-Directional Contract Testing (BDCT) provides the ability to "upgrade" your existing tools into a powerful contract-testing solution, simplifying adoption and reducing the time to implement contract testing across your architecture.

BDCT is a feature exclusive to PactFlow and is not available in the Pact OSS project.

**A note for Pact users**: when contract testing with Pact, you need to write and maintain a separate set of (Pact) tests that are responsible for ensuring systems are compatible. The tests on the consumer side produce a consumer contract containing the example scenarios which must be supported for the consumer to work, which are then replayed against an actual running provider in a **record and replay** style interaction. If the Provider responds correctly, the contract is valid.

With BDCT, the key difference is that a Provider uploads its own **provider contract** advertising its full capability which is statically compared to the expectations in the consumer contract - the consumer contract is never replayed against the provider code base. This creates a much [simpler](#comparison-to-pact) and decoupled workflow. See the [trade-offs](#trade-offs) for more.

BDCT is not intended to replace Pact testing, but to provide an alternative in the cases where Pact may not be best suited.

## Comparison to Pact

### When to use

Here is an at-a-glance view of the key differences in approaches to achieve the benefits of _contract testing_.

This is not intended as an overall guide to a comprehensive testing strategy and ignores the differences in value of each approach outside of the scope of contract testing.

:::info

**Remember**: Contract tests focus on the messages that flow between a consumer and provider, while functional tests also ensure that the correct side effects have occurred. For example, imagine an endpoint for a collection of `/orders` that accepts a POST request to create a new order. A contract test would ensure that the consumer and provider had a shared and accurate understanding of the request and response required to create an order, while a functional test for the provider would ensure that when a given request was made, that an Order with the correct attributes was actually persisted to the underlying datastore. A contract test does not check for side effects.

:::note understanding the trade-off table

More `+` is better, more `-` is worse. For example, E2E testing has the highest `Guarantee` but the worst with regards to`Flakiness`

## How it works

In the following animation, you can see a high level overview of the process.

:::info

The testing process may be initiated from either the consumer side (_consumer driven_) or provider side (_specification first_)

:::

### Steps

_Provider_

1. Provider starts with its specification (e.g. an OpenAPI specification) referred to as the `Provider Contract`. This may be created by hand or generated by code (e.g. swagger codegen)
2. The `Provider Contract` is tested against the provider, using a functional API testing tool (such as ReadyAPI, SoapUI, RestAssured, Dredd, or Postman) or generated by code (such as via Swashbuckle, Spring Docs)
3. The `Provider Contract` is uploaded to PactFlow
4. When we call `can-i-deploy` the cross-contract validation process in PactFlow generates a `Verification Result` ensuring the provider doesn't break any of its consumers
5. If that passes, we deploy the provider and record the deployment via the `pact-broker record-deployment` command.

_Consumer_

1. Consumer tests its behaviour against a mock (such as Pact or Wiremock)
2. The `Consumer Contract` is produced, in the form of a pact file, that captures _only_ the actual interactions generated by the consumer code
3. The `Consumer Contract` is uploaded to PactFlow
4. When we call `can-i-deploy` the cross-contract validation process in PactFlow generates a `Verification Result` determining if the consumer consumes a valid subset of the provider contract.
5. If that passes, we deploy the consumer and record the deployment via the `pact-broker record-deployment` command.

### Terminology

- **Consumer**: An application that makes use of the functionality or data from another application to do its job. For applications that use HTTP, the consumer is always the application that initiates the HTTP request (eg. the web front end), regardless of the direction of data flow. For applications that use queues, the consumer is the application that reads the message from the queue.

- **Provider**: An application (often called a service) that provides functionality or data for other applications to use, often via an API. For applications that use HTTP, the provider is the application that returns the response. For applications that use queues, the provider (also called producer) is the application that writes the messages to the queue.

- A **consumer contract** is a collection of interactions which describe how the Consumer expects the Provider to behave. Each Consumer will have its own unique consumer contract for each of its Providers.

- A **provider contract** specifies the capability of the Provider. In this workshop, it will take the form of an OpenAPI document, but may be other formats such as a GraphQL schema, a SOAP XSD, a protobuf definition and so on.

- **cross-contract validation** or **contract comparison**: the process by which PactFlow confirms that the consumer contract is a valid subset of a provider contract. For example, it will ensure that all request/responses defined in a pact file and valid resources and match the schemas in a provider OAS file.

## Contract support

### Pact

Consumer contracts must currently be specified in a pact format. You may use any tool, including Pact, to generate a pact file.

Read the documentation on using [Pact as a consumer contract](/docs/bi-directional-contract-testing/contracts/pact) for more on how to convert mocks into the Pact format.

### OpenAPI Specification

Provider contracts may be specified using an OpenAPI Specification.

Read the documentation using [OpenAPI Specification as provider contract](/docs/bi-directional-contract-testing/contracts/oas) for more.
