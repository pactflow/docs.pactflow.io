This page provides compatibility details for a specific integration.

### Matrix

The **Matrix** is a table that shows the verification status for each combination of consumer and provider versions in the selected integration.

Use the Matrix to:

- Quickly check compatibility between applications.
- Narrow down the data using filters.

You can filter **consumer versions** and **provider versions** by selecting:

- Links in the table.
- Filters in the table headers, including version, branch, environment, or tag.

> **Note:** You can filter each participant independently, but only by one facet at a time.

:::tip
The **Environment** filter appears only if you have *read* or *manage* permissions for environments.
:::

Click **View contract** in any row to open the corresponding contract.
