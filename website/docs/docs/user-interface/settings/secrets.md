You can create your own variables to store sensitive values like usernames and passwords here. These will be encrypted and then stored in the PactFlow platform and available to use when creating your webhooks.

| Field | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Team | When creating or updating a secret, users with the `secret:manage:team` permission (by default, assigned to the `User` role) must assign a secret to a team. Team secrets may only be used in webhooks that are assigned to the same team. Users with the `secret:manage:*` permission (by default, assigned to the `Administrator` role) may choose not to assign a secret to any team. Secrets without a team assigned may only be used in webhooks that also have no team assigned. |
| Name | Give a name to your secret. This will be available as a dynamic variable prefixed with `user.`. For instance, if you create a `BuildkiteToken` secret you can access it as `${user.BuildkiteToken}`. |
| Description | Describe what your secret is here. |
| Value | The value you need encrypted. |
