## Version tag menus

The blue and grey "pill" icons shown next to the consumer and provider version numbers on the Overview, Matrix and Pact pages represent [tags](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/tags) that belong to the relevant application versions in PactFlow.

A blue pill indicates that the application version is the latest version that has a tag with that name (eg. the latest consumer version with a "main" tag).

A grey pill indicates that there is a later application version that has the same tag.

<img alt="Not latest version tag menu" src="/ui/tag-main-not-latest.png" style={{width: 70}}/>

Clicking on the tag pill icon will allow you to perform actions in the context of that application version tag.
