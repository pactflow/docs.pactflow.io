[![Pact Status](https://dius.pactflow.io/pacts/provider/pactflow-example-provider-dotnet/consumer/pactflow-pactflow-example-consumer-dotnet/latest/badge.svg?label=provider)](https://dius.pactflow.io/pacts/provider/pactflow-example-provider-dotnet/consumer/pactflow-pactflow-example-consumer-dotnet/latest) (latest pact)

[![Pact Status](https://dius.pactflow.io/matrix/provider/pactflow-example-provider-dotnet/latest/prod/consumer/pactflow-pactflow-example-consumer-dotnet/latest/prod/badge.svg?label=provider)](https://dius.pactflow.io/pacts/provider/pactflow-example-provider-dotnet/consumer/pactflow-pactflow-example-consumer-dotnet/latest/prod) (prod/prod pact)

This is an example of a dotnet core consumer using Pact to create a consumer driven contract, and sharing it via [Pactflow](https://pactflow.io).

It is using a private tenant on Pactflow. The latest version of the Example Consumer/Example Provider pact is published [here](https://dius.pactflow.io/pacts/provider/pactflow-example-provider-dotnet/consumer/pactflow-pactflow-example-consumer-dotnet/latest).

The project uses a Makefile to simulate a very simple build pipeline with two stages - test and deploy.

* Test
  * Run tests (including the pact tests that generate the contract)
  * Publish pacts, tagging the consumer version with the name of the current branch
  * Check if we are safe to deploy to prod (ie. has the pact content been successfully verified)
* Deploy (only from master)
  * Deploy app (just pretend for the purposes of this example!)
  * Tag the deployed consumer version as 'prod'

## Usage
