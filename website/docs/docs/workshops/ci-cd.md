title: Consumer-Driven Contract Testing CI/CD Workshop
sidebar_label: Introduction
---

A workshop demonstrating how to set up a CI/CD pipeline for a consumer and provider using Pact, PactFlow and Github Actions.

It uses the PactFlow [example-consumer][example-consumer] and [example-provider][example-provider] repositories. These are written in Node, however, extensive node experience will not be required for the workshop.

## Goals

* To understand how Pact and PactFlow fit into the CI/CD pipelines of a consumer and provider.
* To understand the workflows involved in making changes to both consumer and provider.
* To understand how Pact + PactFlow stop breaking changes from being deployed to a given environment.

[example-provider]: https://github.com/pactflow/example-provider

:::info

This workflow uses the [`branches`](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/branches) & [`record-deployment`](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/recording_deployments_and_releases) first-class features of Pact/PactFlow and uses features not available with [tags](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/tags#using-tags) .

All of the major Pact client libraries have support, and a full support matrix can be shown [here](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/branches#support).

If you are not using one of the libraries that currently supported, you can follow previous method of publishing and verifying pacts using tags via our [ci/cd legacy workshop](https://docs.pactflow.io/docs/workshops/ci-cd-legacy).

We would recommend running this workshop regardless, as it will showcase advanced features of Pact.

If you are still using `tags` and need more of a reason to switch, have a read of these posts
