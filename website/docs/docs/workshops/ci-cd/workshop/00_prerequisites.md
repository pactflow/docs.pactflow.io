title: Prerequisites
---

* CI/CD pipelines for the consumer and provider as per the [Setup CI/CD page](/docs/workshops/ci-cd/set-up-ci)
* A working local development set up as per the [Setup local development](/docs/workshops/ci-cd/set-up-local-development) page.
* Both consumer and provider builds in Github Actions should both be passing on master.
* If you have access to a second screen, we recommend that you use it for this workshop, as there is a lot of window switching involved. You might want to put all the consumer windows on one screen, and all the provider windows on the other.
* Suggested window configuration:
    * In Github:
        * One tab for the example-consumer build
        * One tab for the example-provider build
    * In PactFlow:
        * A tab for the example pact dashboard
    * In your editor of choice:
        * One window for the example-consumer
        * One window for the example-provider
    * In your terminal of choice:
        * One shell for the example-consumer
        * One shell for the example-provider
    * Close everything else that you can! It can get confusing switching backwards and forwards between all the windows in the workshop.
