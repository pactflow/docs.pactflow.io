The next step is to implement the changes that have been requested in the pact.

1. Open up the terminal for your provider project.

1. Run `make test` to make sure everything is passing before you start.

1. Get the URL of the new pact:
    * Go to your PactFlow account, find the new pact on the consumer branch `feat/new-field` and click "VIEW PACT".
    * In the top right, click the 3 dots and select `Copy pact URL for pactflow-example-consumer-legacy version xyz`.

2. Run `PACT_URL=<PACT URL HERE> make test` again. This test should correctly fail with the error `Could not find key "color"` in the output.
    * ðŸ‘‰ This little "verify a custom pact" trick works because of the code in in `src/product/product.pact.test.js` that switches between doing a "fetch pacts for these consumer version selectors" mode and a "verify the pact at the `$PACT_URL`" mode, based on whether or not the `$PACT_URL` is set. The `$PACT_URL` code path is normally used when the build is triggered by a "contract requiring verification published" webhook, and allows us to verify just the changed pact against the providers main branch and any deployed (or released) versions.

3. Make the test pass by adding a `color` field to `product/product.js`, and adding the new color argument to the Product initialization lines in `product/product.repository.js` and the provider states in `product/product.pact.test.js`.

    ```js
    constructor(id, type, name, version, color) {
      this.id = id;
      this.type = type;
      this.name = name;
      this.version = version;
      this.color = color;
    }
    ```

    ```js
    constructor() {
        this.products = new Map([
            ["09", new Product("09", "CREDIT_CARD", "Gem Visa", "v1", "green")],
            ["10", new Product("10", "CREDIT_CARD", "28 Degrees", "v1", "blue")],
            ["11", new Product("11", "PERSONAL_LOAN", "MyFlexiPay", "v2", "yellow")],
        ]);
    }
    ```

    ```js
    const stateHandlers = {
      "products exists": () => {
        controller.repository.products = new Map([
          ["10", new Product("10", "CREDIT_CARD", "28 Degrees", "v1","blue")],
        ]);
      },
      "products exist": () => {
        controller.repository.products = new Map([
          ["10", new Product("10", "CREDIT_CARD", "28 Degrees", "v1","blue")],
        ]);
      },
      "a product with ID 10 exists": () => {
        controller.repository.products = new Map([
          ["10", new Product("10", "CREDIT_CARD", "28 Degrees", "v1","blue")],
        ]);
      },
      "a product with ID 11 does not exist": () => {
        controller.repository.products = new Map();
      },
    };
    ```

4. Run `PACT_URL=<PACT URL HERE> make test` and you should have a passing test suite. âœ…

5. Commit and push your changes.
   1. `git add . && git commit -m 'feat: add color' && git push`

## Expected state by the end of this step

* A provider that implements the features required by the `feat/new-field` pact on its `master` branch.
* A passing provider build in Github Actions.
* The new version of the provider is "deployed" to production.
* A `feat/new-field` pact with a failed verification result

## Conclusion

The `master` provider is now compatible with the `feat/new-field` pact. However, there is still a failing verification result published for the `feat/new-field` pact, triggered by a webhook (contract requiring verification published) when the new pact was published.

We verified the Pact would pass against our providers main branch `master` by passing in the Pact URL directly, however because it was only verified on a development machine, and we don't typically publish verification results from dev machines.

The next step is getting a result back to PactFlow so that the consumer knows they are safe to merge.
