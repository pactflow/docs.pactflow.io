## The Provider

### Design the API

As we are following a specification or [design first approach](https://swagger.io/blog/api-design/design-first-or-code-first-api-development/) to API development, we start by creating an [OpenAPI](https://oai.github.io/Documentation/start-here.html) description document, that describes how our API should work.

Authoring an OAS document is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but you can find plenty of resources on the internet (such as at [swagger.io](https://swagger.io)).

```

As you can see, we have 3 main endpoints:

1. `POST /products` - create a new product
1. `GET /products` - gets all products
1. `GET /products/:id` - gets a single product

Having designed our API, we can now set about building it.

### Implement the Product API

Here is the Product API using the [Express JS](https://expressjs.com) framework. Once again, writing an API is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

We define our product, the available routes, the datastore (an simple in-memory database) and the server.

```js reference
https://github.com/pactflow/example-bi-directional-provider-dredd/blob/master/src/product/product.js#L1-L8
```

```js reference
https://github.com/pactflow/example-bi-directional-provider-dredd/blob/master/src/product/product.routes.js#L1-L8
```

```js reference
https://github.com/pactflow/example-bi-directional-provider-dredd/blob/master/src/product/product.repository.js#L1-L26
```

```js reference
https://github.com/pactflow/example-bi-directional-provider-dredd/blob/master/src/product/product.controller.js#L1-L19
```

```js reference
https://github.com/pactflow/example-bi-directional-provider-dredd/blob/master/server.js#L1-L16
```

:::info
You can pick your provider now
:::

<div>
  {generateTestingToolsTab({
    data: meta.testing_tools_provider_side,
    withLabel: true,
    withLink: false,
  })}
</div>

### Fork and clone the provider

1. Fork the [example-bi-directional-provider-dredd](https://github.com/pactflow/example-bi-directional-provider-dredd) project in to your own Github account (click the 'Fork' button in the top right).
2. Clone the repository on to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/example-bi-directional-provider-dredd.git
    ```

3. Install the dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Check

Before moving to the next step, cd into the `example-bi-directional-provider-dredd` directory and run the provider to see if it starts.

The tutorial environment should have installed 2 projects and their dependencies. Once the terminal process completes you can run:

1. `cd /root/example-bi-directional-provider-dredd`
1. `npm i`
1. `npm start`

Open up a separate terminal and run the following command:

1. `cd /root/example-bi-directional-provider-dredd`
1. `curl localhost:3001/products | jq .`

You should see the following output:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "09",
    "type": "CREDIT_CARD",
    "name": "Gem Visa",
    "version": "v1",
    "price": 99.99
  },
  {
    "id": "10",
    "type": "CREDIT_CARD",
    "name": "28 Degrees",
    "version": "v1",
    "price": 49.49
  },
  {
    "id": "11",
    "type": "PERSONAL_LOAN",
    "name": "MyFlexiPay",
    "version": "v2",
    "price": 16.5
  }
]
```

Switch back to your first terminal and terminate (`ctrl-c`) the process to make sure your provider is no longer running.
