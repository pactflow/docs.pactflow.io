## Introduction

Bi-directional contracts is a Pactflow only feature that allows teams to generate a contract from existing mocks (such as Wiremock) and to verify API providers using the functional API testing tools they are already using (such as Postman). Teams can use our plug-and-play adapters for popular tools or write their own.

When contract-testing with Pact, you need to write and maintain a separate set of tests that are responsible for ensuring systems are compatible.

Bi-directional contracts provides the ability to “upgrade” your existing tools into a powerful contract-testing solution, simplifying adoption and reducing the time to implement contract testing across your architecture.

## Use Cases

| Retrofitting contract-testing onto an existing system                              | Writing many Pact tests to cover all scenarios can be time-consuming                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Bi-directional contracts lets you re-use existing tools to get greater coverage faster                                                                                                          |
| API Gateways                                                                       | Pass through systems can be cumbersome to test with Pact (particularly handling state and mocking systems)                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Using specifications as the contract simplifies the approach                                                                                                                                    |
| Internal APIs with large numbers of consumers                                      | Many consumers can make testing with Pact difficult, due to challenges with provider states and release co-ordination                                                                                                                                                                                           | Bi-directional contracts is ideally suited as it decouples teams, and is particularly useful with fairly stable APIs (e.g. Auth)                                                                |
| Testing against 3rd party APIs                                                     | Pact is not ideally suited to 3rd party APIs because 3rd parties are unlikely to validate your Pacts                                                                                                                                                                                                            | By pulling in the third party's API specification (OAS) regularly, you can continually ensure your consumers are compatible                                                                     |
| Internal microservices following a contract-first approach (OpenAPI Specification) | Contract testing is ideally suited to internal service-to-service testing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Bi-directional contracts can speed this process up by re-using the OAS as the provider spec                                                                                                     |
| Web based contract tests (e.g. Cypress, MSW)                                       | Web applications tend to make heavy use of mocking/stubbing, which could result in of getting out of sync with the Provider API implementation. Further, using Pact from these tools can [lead to challenges](https://pactflow.io/blog/a-disastrous-tale-of-ui-testing-with-pact/) if not carefully implemented | Bi-directional contracts removes the need for additional Pact tests and the problem associated with too many interactions in a contract                                                         |
| Monolith to microservice migrations                                                | For example, gradually splitting of microservices using the "strangler" pattern, or to a complete new design                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Contract testing helps you migrate from your legacy applications to a modernised architecture by preventing breaking changes. When existing contract tests pass, you know it's safe to cutover. |

<!-- | Public APIs (documented via OpenAPI Specifications) | Open Banking | Pact is not ideally suited to public APIs because you don't have consumers creating tests. With bi-directional contracts, you could allow consumers to use contract-testing in a more decoupled way | -->

:::note understanding the trade-off table

More `+` is better, more `-` is worse. For example, E2E testing has the highest `Guarantee` but the worst with regards to`Flakiness`

:::

## How it works

In the following animation, you can see a high level overview of the process.

<video width="100%" controls="controls">
  <source src="/workshops/bi-directional/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

:::info

The testing process may be initiated from either the consumer side (_consumer driven_) or provider side (_specification first_)

:::

### Steps

_Consumer_

1. Consumer tests its behaviour against a mock (such as Pact or Wiremock)
2. The `Consumer Contract` is produced, in the form of a pact file, that captures _only_ the actual interactions generated by the consumer code
3. The `Consumer Contract` is uploaded to Pactflow
4. When we call `can-i-deploy` the cross-contract validation process in Pactflow generates a `Verification Result` determining if the consumer consumes a valid subset of the provider contract.

_Provider_

1. Provider starts with its specification (e.g. an OpenAPI specification) referred to as the `Provider Contract`. This may be created by hand or generated by code (e.g. swagger codegen)
2. The `Provider Contract` is tested against the provider, using a functional API testing tool (such as RestAssured, Dredd, or Postman) or
3. The `Provider Contract` is uploaded to Pactflow
4. When we call `can-i-deploy` the cross-contract validation process in Pactflow generates a `Verification Result` ensuring the provider doesn't break any of its consumers

## Contract support

### Pact

Consumer contracts must currently be specified in a pact format. You may use any tool, including Pact, to generate a pact file.

Read the documentation on using [Pact as a consumer contract](/docs/workshops/bi-directional/contracts/pact) for more on how to convert mocks into the Pact format.

### OpenAPI Specification

Provider contracts may be specified using an OpenAPI Specification.

Read the documentation using [OpenAPI Specification as provider contract](/docs/workshops/bi-directional/contracts/oas) for more.
