title: OpenAPI Specification Contracts
sidebar_label: Overview
---

Providers may specify an OpenAPI Specification as a Provider Contract, enabling teams to get reuse out of existing tools and processes.

## Supported versions

| Version           | Supported? |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| Swagger (1.x)     | ❌         |
| Swagger (2.0)     | ✅         |
| OAS (up to 3.0.3) | ✅         |

## Compatibility with Consumer Contracts

Pact Consumer Contracts are the only compatible contracts at this time.

## Publishing the Provider Contract + Results to PactFlow

There are several ways to currently publish contracts to PactFlow.

The links in the list will take you to the respective documentation in each repo.

Otherwise see the [Installation](#installation) section and [Usage](#usage) instructions on this page.

<!-- ### Directly via API

1. `publish_contracts` ([API Reference](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact_broker/blob/master/lib/pact_broker/doc/views/index/publish-contracts.markdown)) / [Example via Makefile](https://github.com/pactflow/example-bi-directional-provider-restassured/blob/d562158cd0920eb57e5ba7007e65db4a9f08cbe9/Makefile#L32) / [Example Script](https://github.com/pactflow/example-bi-directional-provider-restassured/blob/master/scripts/publish.sh)
 1. This will associate the `version` with a `provider contract`

#### Example

We will take you through an example below.

> The standard authorization environment variables are used here.

Here is an example bash script that uses `cURL` to create the branch version for the specified application to PactFlow.

1. `create_branch_version.sh` ([API Reference](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact_broker/blob/master/lib/pact_broker/doc/views/index/pacticipant-branch-version.markdown)) / [Example via Makefile](https://github.com/pactflow/example-bi-directional-provider-restassured/blob/d562158cd0920eb57e5ba7007e65db4a9f08cbe9/Makefile#L26) / [Example Script](https://github.com/pactflow/example-bi-directional-provider-restassured/blob/master/scripts/create_branch_version.sh)

```sh
#!/bin/bash

echo "==> Creating version branch for ${PACTICIPANT}"
curl \
-X PUT \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${PACT_BROKER_TOKEN}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"${PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL}/pacticipants/${PACTICIPANT}/branches/${GIT_BRANCH}/versions/${COMMIT}" \
-d '{}
}'
````

Here is an example bash script that uses `cURL` to upload the the OAS and test results to PactFlow.

2. `publish.sh` ([API Reference](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact_broker/blob/master/lib/pact_broker/doc/views/index/publish-contracts.markdown)) / [Example via Makefile](https://github.com/pactflow/example-bi-directional-provider-restassured/blob/d562158cd0920eb57e5ba7007e65db4a9f08cbe9/Makefile#L32) / [Example Script](https://github.com/pactflow/example-bi-directional-provider-restassured/blob/master/scripts/publish.sh)

```sh
#!/bin/bash

SUCCESS=true
if [ "${1}" != "true" ]; then
  SUCCESS=false
fi
OAS=$(cat oas/swagger.yml | base64) # Pass the "-w 0" flag if on linux
REPORT=$(cat /path/to/report.file | base64)

echo "==> Uploading OAS to PactFlow"
curl \
  -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${PACT_BROKER_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "${PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL}/contracts/provider/${PACTICIPANT}/version/${COMMIT}" \
  -d '{
   "content": "'$OAS'",
   "contractType": "oas",
   "contentType": "application/yaml",
   "verificationResults": {
     "success": '$SUCCESS',
     "content": "'$REPORT'",
     "contentType": "text/plain",
     "verifier": "verifier"
   }
 }'
```

Usage: `./publish.sh true|false`

#### Request Details

`publish_contracts` ([API Reference](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact_broker/blob/master/lib/pact_broker/doc/views/index/publish-contracts.markdown)) / [Example via Makefile](https://github.com/pactflow/example-bi-directional-provider-restassured/blob/d562158cd0920eb57e5ba7007e65db4a9f08cbe9/Makefile#L32) / [Example Script](https://github.com/pactflow/example-bi-directional-provider-restassured/blob/master/scripts/publish.sh)

**Path**

The request should be a `PUT` to the following path:

```
{baseUrl}/contracts/provider/{application}/version/{version}
```

- `baseURL`

  The base URL of your PactFlow account e.g. https://myaccount.pactflow.io

- `application`

  The name of the provider API application

- `version`

  The version of the provider API application

**Body**

The following describes the body that should be sent in the API

- `content`

  The base64 encoded contents of the OAS (see [base64 encoding](#base64-encoding) below)

- `contractType`

  Must be `oas`

- `content_type`

  Must be `application/yaml`

- `verificationResults`

  This object contains the information about the test results

- `verificationResults.success`

  A boolean value indicating if the tests passed or failed (one of `true` or `false`)

- `verificationResults.content`

  The base64 encoded test results, which may be any output of your choosing (see [base64 encoding](#base64-encoding) below).

- `verificationResults.contentType`

  The content type of the results. Must be a valid mime type

- `verificationResults.verifier`

  The name of the tool used to perform the verification

  -->

## Interpreting verification result failures

Verification results are generated dynamically when `can-i-deploy` is invoked for a given set of application versions and target environments.

When `can-i-deploy` is called, you will get a table of results that shows which applications are compatible and the verification URL which explains the results.

_Output from can-i-deploy_

```
CONSUMER                       | C.VERSION          | PROVIDER                       | P.VERSION          | SUCCESS? | RESULT#
-------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------|----------|--------
pactflow-example-consumer-w... | 5785fb8+1622544123 | pactflow-example-provider-r... | 7f3d83f+1622544125 | true     | 1

VERIFICATION RESULTS
--------------------
1. https://testdemo.pactflow.io/hal-browser/browser.html#https://testdemo.pactflow.io/contracts/provider/pactflow-example-bi-directional-provider-restassured/version/7f3d83f%2B1622544125/consumer/pactflow-example-bi-directional-consumer-wiremock/pact-version/b421f8d1c0691e8304492c716e546427c4267c7f/verification-results (success)
```

Clicking on the verification results will take you to the resource in PactFlow and show you the detailed analysis.

### Response Object

- `summary`

  Whether or not the verification was successful

- `crossContractVerificationResults`

  This element contains the results of comparing the mock (pact contract) to the OpenAPI specification

- `providerContractVerificationResults`

  This contains the results of the provider verification, including the tool used to verify it, whether the test passed or failed and the base64 encoded OAS contract.

```

In the case of a failure, the following elements of the `error` are most helpful in diagnosing the problem:

- `message`

  Summary of the problem. In most cases, you can understand the problem immediately. As above, you can see there are two errors - one for the request body, and another for the response body.
  In both cases (the request and response body), there is an additional unexpected property `price` expected by the consumer.

- `mockDetails`

  Contains details of the Consumer Contract (mock) that are problematic, including the path to the interaction in the contract and the request/response details.

- `specDetails`

  Contains details of the Provider Contract (spec) that are problematic, including the path to the component of the resource in the OpenAPI specification the mock is incompatible with.

## Considerations

When using OpenAPI Specifications as a Provider Contract, you should be aware of the following limitations.

Some of these considerations are captured for future enhancements [here](https://github.com/pactflow/roadmap/labels/OAS)
### Document limitations

- The OAS must be a valid YAML or JSON file. PactFlow will pre-validate the document is parseable and error if they aren't valid.
- OAS documents must not be split across multiple files. You should combine any documents together, using tools like [OpenAPI Merge](https://github.com/robertmassaioli/openapi-merge) or [speccy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/speccy). That is, PactFlow can not resolve remote references to files, and will not resolve URL references
- YAML formatted OAS documents must not use [anchors](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#3222-anchors-and-aliases), due to the potential security issues (see [YAML bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack) for more). If your auto-generated specs have anchors, you can pre-process them via tools like [spruce](https://github.com/geofffranks/spruce), that will expand them for you.
- It is recommended to programmatically dereference and inline `$refs` in the OAS document uploaded to PactFlow, as they can cause issues when validating `nullable` fields and nested `$refs` can not be accurately compared with a pact file. This can be accomplished using packages such as [json-schema-merge-allof](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-schema-merge-allof) and [json-schema-resolve-allof](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-schema-resolve-allof)
- Comparison of Pact interactions to OAS endpoints does not consider any `basePath` in its comparison. In [OAS 3 (and also 2)](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/api-host-and-base-path/), all API endpoints are considered to be relative to the base URL. For example, assuming the base URL of `https://api.example.com/v1`, the `/users` endpoint refers to `https://api.example.com/v1/users`. Our comparison does not consider the impact of `basePath` as there may be multiple servers with different context paths and there is no clear way to resolve this ambiguity. In this example, a pact interaction with path `/v1/users/` will not match an OAS that only has `/users/` in its resource path. 
 

### Testing

- Note, PactFlow automatically sets `additionalProperties` in your OAS is set to `false` on any response body, to ensure a consumer won't get false positives if they add a new field that isn't actually part of the spec (see
  https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/swagger-mock-validator/issues/84/test-incorrectly-passes-when-mock-expects for an interesting read on why this is necessary. TL;DR - it's JSON Schemas fault)
- It is recommended to allow `additionalProperties` on request items to align with [Postel's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle)
- _Implementing_ a spec is not the same as being _compatible_ with a spec ([read more](https://pactflow.io/blog/contract-testing-using-json-schemas-and-open-api-part-1/)). Most tools only tell you that what you’re doing is _not incompatible_ with the spec. _NOTE: We plan to address this problem in the future via our OAS Testing Tool_
- You are responsible for ensuring sufficient OAS coverage.
