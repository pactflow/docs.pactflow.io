## July 2023

:::warning

If you are here because tests that were previously passing are now failing, it is likely that your use of the `discriminator` keyword is incompatible with our latest update. Refer to [this guide](/docs/bi-directional-contract-testing/contracts/oas/keyword-support#how-to-use-discriminator) for how to correct this, and more generally our [compatibility checks](/docs/bi-directional-contract-testing/compatibility-checks) guide for understanding the errors and warnings

:::

* Support for OAS 3.1
* As per JSON Schema [guidance](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/numeric.html), numbers are not coerced into narrow types such as `int64`, `int32` and `float`, with support only for `number` and `integer`. Validation has been relaxed to accommodate this (see https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-formats/pull/22#issuecomment-808896823).
* `nullable` now requires use of `type`, see https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/490eb8c0eba8392d071fef005e16d330f259d0ba/lib/compile/validate/dataType.ts#L26C66-L26C66.
* Transformations to OAS document applied to improve use of `anyOf`, `oneOf`, `allOf` and polymorphic payloads.

## June 2023

* Support for V4 Pacts added
* Added full [RFC 9110: HTTP Semantics ยง12](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#section-12.1) support for content-types, content-negotiation and vendor specific media types
* Support for negative scenario testing
