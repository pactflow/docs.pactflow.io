## Principles

It is important you use a _mock_ and not a _stub_. The crucial difference is that a mock validates behaviour, a stub does not. We need to ensure that your consumer code actually calls the mock, otherwise we will serialise a contract with invalid expectations.

## Writing Consumer Contracts

### Prerequisite: choose a mocking tool

If you're not using Pact, you need to pick a tool that you are able to extract the mocking information from or use a pre-existing [adapter](#community-adapters), in order to convert it to a pact file.

Some tools have options to serialise their mocks to a file, and others will require you to introspect via their APIs. You should take this into consideration in advance.

### Step 1: Write your consumer tests

Once you have chosen your tool, you must implement your consumer side tests. It is important here that you exercise all of the API behaviour your system expects to ensure you have the coverage you need.

One notably deviation from Pact advice is that you need not concern yourself with finding the minimul set of tests for a contract, and are free to use mocks for any fuctional testing. In fact, this is encouraged.

(Reference to standard contract testing advice: <https://docs.pact.io/consumer/contract_tests_not_functional_tests/>)

### Step 2: Convert your mocks (writing the pact adapter)

_NOTE: If you chose Pact in Step 1, you can skip to Step 3._

Read the [documentation](./contracts/pact) on how to generate a pact contract from your mocks.

We will be building adapters for common mocking tools as we expand this feature. See current [community contributed adapters](#community-adapters) below.

### Step 3: Publish your contract

Uploading a pact file is the same as the standard [Pact process](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/publishing_and_retrieving_pacts/).

We recommend using the `pact-broker publish` command from [CLI Tools](https://docs.pact.io/implementation_guides/cli/#distributions) for this step. Our examples use the Docker version of this to simplify administration.

### Step 4: Run can-i-deploy

[`can-i-deploy`](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/can_i_deploy/) gives you immediate feedback if you are safe to release a version of an application to a specified environment (such as `production`).

We recommend using the `pact-broker can-i-deploy` command from [CLI Tools](https://docs.pact.io/implementation_guides/cli/#distributions) for this step. Our examples use the Docker version of this to simplify administration.

The output from the command will provide a link to the verification result in PactFlow. Interpreting these results is contract specific.

Here is our pipeline to date on the first run of a consumer:

### Step 5: Deploy your application

If `can-i-deploy` returns a successful response, you can deploy your application. Once your application is deployed, you can notify PactFlow of the release - see the [recording deployments & releases] (<https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/recording_deployments_and_releases>) docs

_Golden rule:_

> Associate with the branch name when you publish pacts or verification results, and record the deployment or release into any environment.

## Integrating it into your CI/CD pipeline

A simplified view of a CI/CD pipeline for Pact looks like this:

![Consumer Pipeline](/workshops/bi-directional/3-bi-directional-consumer-pipeline-deployed.png "Consumer Pipeline")

The standard [principles](https://docs.pact.io/pact_nirvana) are still relevent. Our [CI/CD workshop](/docs/workshops/ci-cd) is a useful reference (NOTE: the CI/CD workshop uses the consumer-driven mode using Pact).

## Community Adapters

All of the official and community adapters and guides can be found at [tooling integration](/docs/bi-directional-contract-testing/tools).
