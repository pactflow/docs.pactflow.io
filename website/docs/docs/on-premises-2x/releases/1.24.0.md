## Release date

6 June 2023

## Features

* Upgrade to Ruby 3.2
* Execute missing pact/OAS comparisons asynchronously to prevent can-i-deploy HTTP requests timing out. See [blog post](https://pactflow.io/blog/resilient-builds-with-can-i-deploy-2/).
* Allow pacticipants to be searched by name using the query string `?q={term}`
* Add pagination to teams endpoint
* Compress response payloads with gzip
* Upgrade to latest swagger-mock-validator
* When comparing a pact and OAS for a bi-directional contract, select OAS response schema based on accept and request schema based on content-type headers
* When comparing a pact and OAS for a bi-directional contract, support comparisons for [Pact V4 bodies](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-specification/tree/version-4#bodies) rather than treating the section as JSON.

## Fixes

* Fix error raised when querying the matrix for an integration using bi-directional contracts with a single selector and no 'deploy to' selector (tag, environment, or branch).
* Fix error raised when updating a team with a team member that has been marked as inactive.
* SCIM - allow externalIdpId and externalIdpUsername fields to be writable in the create user endpoint, to ensure provisioned user details are correctly matched with the newly logged in user details.
* Add missing validation for the provider version branch when fetching pacts for verification, to ensure that empty strings are disallowed
