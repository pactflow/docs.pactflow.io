## Release date

10 April 2024

## Features

* Add team-specific metric details via an endpoint `/metrics/teams`

## Fixes

* Fix bug where a user with `environment:team:read` permission received a 403 when performing a GET request for an individual environment
* Ensure matrix and can-i-deploy use the latest revision of the pact when using bi-directional contracts and the pact for a consumer version is modified
* Fix bug where searching integrations in the dashboard would only search from the first 1000 integrations
* Improved performance of the `/admin/users` endpoint
* Disables “dangerous contract modification” by default for new installations. Existing on-premises installations are unaffected. See https://docs.pactflow.io/docs/troubleshooting/disabling-dangerous-contract-modification/#on-premesis-1 for more, and how to disable it for existing installations.
