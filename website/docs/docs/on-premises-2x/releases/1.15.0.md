## Migration notes

This release upgrades the base image from alpine3.13 to alpine3.15. **Please note that Docker 19.03 is no longer supported** as it is EOL and alpine3.15 requires Docker 20.10.0 or later (see point 2 in the `faccessat2` section of the [Alpine 3.14 release notes](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Release_Notes_for_Alpine_3.14.0#faccessat2) for more information).

If you are already running PactFlow on Docker 20.10.0 or later, no action is required. Please update your PactFlow image version as normal. If you are running a version of Docker older than 20.10.0, please upgrade your Docker version to 20.10.0 or later before upgrading to PactFlow 1.15.0.
