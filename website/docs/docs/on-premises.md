## System architecture

### Minimum requirements

* An application server capable of running Docker
* PostgreSQL database
* SAML IDP for SSO
* PactFlow license file

### Recommended architecture

* Deploy to a service designed for Docker container orchestration (ECS, Fargate, Kubernetes etc.)

### Example AWS deployment using ECS

## Internal architecture

The PactFlow On-Premises application is distributed as a Docker image. It is based on the open source [Pact Broker](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact_broker), which is a Ruby application.

### Application user requirements

The PactFlow application does not need any elevated privileges to run. It runs under the user `app:app`.

### Application port

The PactFlow application runs on port `9292` by default. This can be configured by setting the [PACTFLOW_HTTP_PORT](/docs/on-premises/environment-variables#pactflow_http_port) environment variable.

### Healthcheck endpoint

A healthcheck endpoint for use by a Docker container managment service is available at `http://<HOST>/diagnostic/status/heartbeat`. No authentication is required. This endpoint does not make a connection to the database.

If the healthcheck is running from inside the container, make sure to use the port defined in the environment variable `$PACTFLOW_HTTP_PORT`, which defaults to 9292. You can use `wget` to perform the healthcheck request.

An example healthcheck configuration for Docker Compose:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "wget", "-nv", "-t1", "--spider", "http://localhost:9292/diagnostic/status/heartbeat"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
```

To check the connection to the database, use the endpoint `/diagnostic/status/dependencies`. This endpoint should not be used by Docker container managment services, as unrelated database issues might cause the Docker container to churn.

### License file

PactFlow on-premises version requires a license file to run. [Contact us](https://support.smartbear.com/pactflow/message/) if you have not
received one when your account was setup. See the [section on licenses for installation instructions](/docs/on-premises/license).
