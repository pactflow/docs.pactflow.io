title: Docker Compose example
---

In this guide, we'll provide an example `docker compose` setup so that you can see how all of the bits hang together. We will demonstrate:

* Authenticating to Quay.io
* Running the PactFlow enterprise container
* Persistent storage with a postgres database

**Pre-requsites**
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* A working *nix environment and access to a terminal
* Valid credentials to authenticate to our [Docker image registry](docker-image-registry)
* PactFlow license file

## 1. Authenticating to Quay.io

After obtaining valid robot credentials, you need to authenticate to Quay.io so that the docker engine is able to fetch our images.

```
docker login -u="<username>" -p="<password>" quay.io
docker pull quay.io/pactflow/enterprise
```

After this, you should have the latest PactFlow enterprise image on your machine. You can verify by executing

```sh
docker images quay.io/pactflow/enterprise
```

Which should produce an output such as:

```sh
> docker images quay.io/pactflow/enterprise
REPOSITORY                    TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
quay.io/pactflow/enterprise   1.9.0               32db429fda01        7 weeks ago         454MB
quay.io/pactflow/enterprise   latest              32db429fda01        7 weeks ago         454MB
quay.io/pactflow/enterprise   1.8.0               7f9b3c3aa50e        3 months ago        462MB
```

## 2. PactFlow license file

The PactFlow on-premises version requires a license file to run. You should have received this from us during the
on-boarding process. If not, please contact your Account Manager.

Save the license file into a temporary directory with the name `pactflow-onprem.lic` (it needs to be the same directory as used in step 3).

## 3. Startup PactFlow and supporting services

Save the below file as `docker-compose.yml` in the same directory as the license file and then run `docker-compose up`:

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  pactflow:
    image: quay.io/pactflow/enterprise
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    environment:
      # This is set to localhost for this example but in a real deployment, this needs to be set to the actual URL of the application
      - PACTFLOW_BASE_URL=http://localhost
      # Insecure setting only for the purposes of this demo! Not to be used in production.
      - PACTFLOW_DATABASE_SSLMODE=disable
      # Insecure setting only for the purposes of this demo! Not to be used in production.
      - PACTFLOW_REQUIRE_HTTPS=false
      # Demo auth should only be used for demo purposes. Not to be used in production.
      - PACTFLOW_DEMO_AUTH_ENABLED=true
      # 'Allow all' for the webhook host whitelist should only be used for demo purposes. See docs for configuring this in production.
      - PACTFLOW_WEBHOOK_HOST_WHITELIST=/.*/
      - PACTFLOW_HTTP_PORT=9292
      - PACTFLOW_DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@postgres/postgres
      - Short log format only for demo purposes. Use json in production.
      - PACTFLOW_LOG_FORMAT=short
      - PACTFLOW_LOG_LEVEL=info
      - PACTFLOW_ADMIN_API_KEY=admin
      - PACTFLOW_MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY=thisissomerandombytes
      - PACTFLOW_COOKIE_SECRET=at-least-64-char-secret---------at-least-64-char-secret---------
      - PACT_BROKER_ADMIN_API_KEY=admin 
      - PACTFLOW_HTTP_LOGGING_ENABLED=true
    ports:
      - "80:9292"
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "wget", "-nv", "-t1", "--spider", "http://localhost:9292/diagnostic/status/heartbeat"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
    entrypoint: dockerize
    command: -wait tcp://postgres:5432 docker-entrypoint
    volumes:
      - ./pactflow-onprem.lic:/home/pactflow-onprem.lic

  postgres:
    image: postgres:13-alpine
    healthcheck:
      test: psql postgres --command "select 1" -U postgres
    volumes:
      - postgres-volume:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: postgres

volumes:
  postgres-volume:
```

You can verify all services by running `docker ps`:

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                         COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                             PORTS                                                    NAMES

```

## 3. Login to PactFlow

Head to [http://localhost](http://localhost) in your browser, and choose to login with "PACTFLOW DEMO AUTH". Provide a name and email address to create your account and login. (The details don't need to be valid, and won't be used to send any emails.)

That's it ðŸŽ‰.

For production use, you'll need to replicate this setup using a proper container orchestration tool, such as Kubernetes, AWS ECS/Fargate, AKS, GKE, Mesos etc, and your real Identity Provider.
