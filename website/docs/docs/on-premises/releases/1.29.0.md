## Release date

30 January 2024

## Features

* The GET /integrations endpoint returns verification modes: replay or comparison along with other integration details
* Added OAS for consumer contract publication
* Reduce time for a successful can-i-deploy result when using bi-directional contracts by reducing the number of historical branches to generate pact/OAS comparisons for

## Fixes

* Add validation to ensure a pacticipant cannot be created with an empty name when publishing a contract.
* Fix performance issues due to contention in the integrations table when publishing a large number of contracts (> 20) per request, in parallel
* Fix contention on the API tokens table when large numbers of parallel requests come in with the same token
* Correct the logic used to calculate the pactRevisionsPerConsumerVersion distribution in the metrics endpoint
