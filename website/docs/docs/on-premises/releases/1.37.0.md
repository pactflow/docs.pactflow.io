## Release date

11 July 2025

## Features

- **Bi-Directional Contract Testing**  
  - A new [comparison engine](https://github.com/pactflow/openapi-pact-comparator/) delivers up to 100Ã— faster performance than the [previous engine](https://github.com/pactflow/swagger-mock-validator/).
  - Support added for [configurable behavior](/docs/bi-directional-contract-testing/contracts/oas/configuration.md).

- **Stub server updates**  
  - Now supports the Pact specification up to version 4.
  - Includes additional [configuration options](/docs/stubs).

- **OpenTelemetry support**
  - Added native [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) (OTel) instrumentation for enhanced observability in on-premise environments.
  - This allows you to monitor API performance, troubleshoot issues faster, and integrate PactFlow into existing observability stacks.
  - See the [OpenTelemetry guide](/docs/on-premises-2x/observability) for setup instructions and details.

- **Minor updates**
  - Added ability to delete an integration in the HAL relations and expose it in the HAL Explorer.

## Fixes

- Improved support for URI-encoded paths in BDC for OpenAPI.
- Stripped Byte Order Mark (BOM) from provider contracts if present.
- Fixed an intermittent 401 error triggered by `auth_ext_script` custom extension.
