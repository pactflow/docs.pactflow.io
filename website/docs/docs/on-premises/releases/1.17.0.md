## Release date

25 February 2022

## Features

* Added support for server side session inactivity timeout, configurable via the environment variable [`PACTFLOW_SESSION_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT`](/docs/on-premises/environment-variables#pactflow_session_inactivity_timeout)

## Migration notes

By default, the `PACTFLOW_SESSION_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT` will be set to the configured value of `PACTFLOW_SESSION_LENGTH`. This effectively disables the feature, for backwards compatibility purposes. If you would like to take advantage of this new feature, set the `PACTFLOW_SESSION_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT` to the value of your choice. If you do not wish to use this feature, no change is required.
