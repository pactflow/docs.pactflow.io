## Release date

6 June 2023

## Features

* Handle Pact V4 content bodies

## Fixes

* Fix error raised when querying the matrix for an integration using bi-directional contracts with a single selector and no 'deploy to' selector (tag, environment, or branch).
* Fix error raised when updating a team with a team member that has been marked as inactive.
* SCIM - allow externalIdpId and externalIdpUsername fields to be writable in the create user endpoint, to ensure provisioned user details are correctly matched with the newly logged in user details.
* Add missing validation for the provider version branch when fetching pacts for verification, to ensure that empty strings are disallowed
