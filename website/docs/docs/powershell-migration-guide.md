As at June 10th, 2020, we will only support TLS1.2+ connections for Web and API access to the PactFlow platform.

## Checking if your system is compatible

You can check if your API client will work by testing against a TLS1.2 test host such as https://tls-v1-2.badssl.com:1012. For Example:


```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -uri https://tls-v1-2.badssl.com:1012/
```

An _unsuccessful_ connection will look as follows:

A _successful_ connection will look as follows:

## Updating your security settings

You can enable TLS1.2 as per below:

```powershell
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
```

You can also enable future protocols (such as TLS1.3) by allowing the client to negotiate multiple protocols:

```powershell
[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12 -bor [System.Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls13;
```
