sidebar_label: Introduction
---

A workshop demonstrating how to set up a CI/CD pipeline for a consumer and provider using Pact, Pactflow and Github Actions.

It uses the Pactflow [example-consumer][example-consumer] and [example-provider][example-provider] repositories. These are written in Node, however, extensive node experience will not be required for the workshop.

## Goals

* To understand how Pact and Pactflow fit into the CI/CD pipelines of a consumer and provider.
* To understand the workflows involved in making changes to both consumer and provider.
* To understand how Pact + Pactflow stop breaking changes from being deployed to a given environment.
